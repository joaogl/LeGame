# LeGame

LeGame was a small school project that was just for fun.
It started as a small Pascal game but it ended with a really different objective.
What I tried to accomplish with this project was a slightly higher level programming interface to create maps for the game, for this, I used Pascal in a procedural paradigm to implement almost an object like paradigm.
It had no real objective it was for pure fun to fullfill my dead times.
